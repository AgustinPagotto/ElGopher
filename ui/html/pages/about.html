    <h2>Why El Gopher?</h2>
    <p>
	Go was the language that really brought back my interest in learning how to properly use a programming language, read books about it and just play around with new projects. That is why i wanted to pay some respect to the language by using the Gopher name, also the "El" part is just "The" but in spanish, and since my primary language is Spanish i liked the wordplay.
