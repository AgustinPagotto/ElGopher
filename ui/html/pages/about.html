  <h2>Why ElGopher?</h2>
  <p>
    Go was the language that really brought back my interest in learning how to
    properly use a programming language, read books about it and just play
    around with new projects. That is why I wanted to pay some respect to the
    language by using the Gopher name, also the "El" part is just "The" but in
    spanish, and since my primary language is Spanish I liked the wordplay.

  <h2>Why the page is so simple?</h2>
  <p>
    The final purpose of this page is not to be flashy neither complicated,
    since I will be posting articles, and some personal projects i want it to be
    as focused and readable as posible.
    <br />
    The other purpose of this page is to be a learning experience, on how to use
    HTMX, Pico.css, GO for web development, docker and how to deploy a webapp.
    <br />
    And the last reason is that it has to reflect a little about me, i like to
    read, i like minimalism and a page that is full of animations and pages
    won't be representing me as a person.
