    <h2>Why ElGopher?</h2>
    <p>
	Go was the language that really brought back my interest in learning how to properly use a programming language, read books about it and just play around with new projects. That is why i wanted to pay some respect to the language by using the Gopher name, also the "El" part is just "The" but in spanish, and since my primary language is Spanish i liked the wordplay.

    <h2>Why the page is so simple?</h2>
    <p>
	The final purpose of this page is not to be flashy neither complicated, since I will be posting articles, and some personal projects i want it to be as focused and readable as posible.
	<br>
	The other purpose of this page is to be a learning experience, on how to use HTMX, Pico.css, GO for web development, docker and how to deploy a webapp.
	<br>
	And the last reason is that it has to reflect a little about me, i like to read, i like minimalism and a page that is full of animations and pages won't be representing me as a person.
